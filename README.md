# Few shot learning

In this work we develop a few-shot object detector that can learn to detect novel objects from only a few annotated examples. 
Our proposed model leverages fully labeled base classes and quickly adapts to novel classes, using a meta feature learner and a reweighting module
within a one-stage detec- tion architecture.
